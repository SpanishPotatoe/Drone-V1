Purpose -- Learn JavaScript, develop code for testing bots

Outline --
* Set up neccessary accounts (Twitch, Johnny 5, etc)
* Start looking at videos, get understanding of Javascripts
  1. basic structure / organization
  2. functions
  3. extra misc features (formating, language specifics, etc)
* Contact father, set up dev spot

Note --
* Var -> variable; defines object
* types -> context of var
          1. number : ex. 1, 230, -1
          2. string : ex. "1"
* If statements -> a function based on conditions, if met does A, if not (else) does B
* functions -> performs an action
* arguements -> specifications within brackets, eliminates repeating
* Return -> calls on a function
* Arrays -> List of items
* Loops -> while / do / for : runs continuous function

Misc --
Java works in context from top to bottom (not pulling from spot to spot)
D.R.Y. -> Do not Repeat Yourself
comparisions with values : < less than; > greater than; <= less than or equal; >= greater than or equal; != not equal
